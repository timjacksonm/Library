## Summary

I decided to unveil apart of my creative side and give this library a Virtual Boy Nintendo theme. This project focused on refining skills I learned from prior lessons. Manipulating an array and display all my game objects to the screen as game cards. Giving the games a "completion" tag or "not completed". Displaying a form when a new game button is clicked. With the form I added an eventListener that took the data and populated the array.
This was a nice creative break before digging into harder projects to come.
